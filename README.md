# E-commerce Data Analysis and SQL Insights

## Description
This project involves loading and analyzing e-commerce data using MySQL and Python. The data includes customer, order, product, seller, payment, and geolocation information. The project focuses on generating meaningful insights from the dataset, such as customer distribution, sales trends, and retention rates, using SQL queries and data visualization techniques.

## Project Overview
The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Data Loading**: The e-commerce data is loaded into a MySQL database from CSV files using Python and SQLAlchemy.
2. **SQL Analysis**: Various SQL queries are used to explore the data, calculate key metrics like total sales, retention rates, and revenue, and identify trends.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualizations are generated using Python to represent data in a more understandable format, helping to uncover patterns and insights.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- **MySQL Server** (locally or remotely).

Required Python libraries:

- `sqlalchemy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pymysql`

Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pandas matplotlib seaborn pymysql
```
## Data Files
The project uses the following CSV files containing the e-commerce dataset:

1. **customers.csv**: Contains information about customers (e.g., customer ID, city, state).
2. **orders.csv**: Contains details about orders (e.g., order ID, purchase timestamp, customer ID).
3. **sellers.csv**: Contains seller information (e.g., seller ID, seller name).
4. **products.csv**: Contains product details (e.g., product ID, product category).
5. **geolocation.csv**: Contains geolocation data (e.g., customer city, state).
6. **payments.csv**: Contains payment details (e.g., payment ID, payment value).
7. **order_items.csv**: Contains details of items in each order (e.g., order ID, product ID, price).

These files are stored in the `dataset/` directory and are loaded into a MySQL database named `ecommerce`.

## Steps

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load data from the CSV files into the MySQL database `ecommerce`.
   - Data is cleaned and transformed as part of the loading process.
   - Each CSV file is loaded into a corresponding table in MySQL.

2. **SQL Analysis**:
   - Execute SQL queries to extract insights from the data, such as:
     - Total number of orders in a specific year.
     - Sales by product category.
     - Percentage of orders paid in installments.
     - Customer retention rates.
     - Revenue generated by sellers.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualize insights using Pythonâ€™s `matplotlib` and `seaborn` libraries.
   - Create bar charts, line graphs, and other visual representations to better understand customer behavior, sales patterns, and more.

## Insights and Learnings

- **Customer Distribution**: A majority of customers are concentrated in certain cities and states, which may help target marketing strategies.
- **Payment Preferences**: The majority of payments are made in installments, indicating a preference for flexible payment options among customers.
- **Sales Trends**: Specific product categories contribute significantly to total sales, highlighting potential areas for promotional efforts or stock optimization.
- **Customer Retention**: The current retention rate is low, indicating an opportunity to improve customer engagement and encourage repeat purchases.
- **Seller Performance**: Some sellers generate a disproportionately large share of total revenue, suggesting the need for further analysis of their product offerings.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce data, helping businesses understand customer behavior, sales trends, and key performance indicators. By analyzing the data through SQL queries and visualizing the results, the project identifies areas for improvement in customer retention, sales strategies, and seller performance.

## Future Improvements
- **Customer Segmentation**: Perform customer segmentation to identify different purchasing patterns and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Build predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data.
- **Advanced SQL Optimization**: Optimize SQL queries for better performance, especially when working with large datasets.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI to allow business stakeholders to explore the data and insights.
